# Controlled Speed Copy

**cscp** copy files and directories with specified speed (in MiB/s).

ok to explain the existence of this project I have to tell a story:

I had a usb memory which came with a factory defect, the memory had a
USB 3.0 connector and when copying files to it, when it reached a
specific speed limit, it showed me a write error so I decided to program
a script that would copy the files at a given speed. and so it did not
show me any error and I was able to save my files safely.
